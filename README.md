# BSL Alphabet Recognition System
This project implements a real-time British Sign Language (BSL) alphabet recognition system using a pre-trained deep learning model,using a webcam to capture hand gestures, processes the video feed, and identifies the corresponding BSL alphabet letter.
## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition from a webcam feed.
- Recognizes specific BSL alphabet letters based on the trained model.
- Displays the predicted letter and constructs a sequence if the same gesture is recognized continuously for 2 seconds.
- Visual feedback, including a highlighted region of interest (ROI) and the recognized sequence.
- Due to restriction , the program corruencly only able to regconise letter to form the word "Welcome to LSBU"
